# Bookworm

Bookworm is a simple and user-friendly web app built using **HTML**, **TailwindCSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app is designed to help users organize, track, and discover books. Users can add books to their collection, leave reviews, and explore new titles.

## Features

- **Reviews**: Write and view reviews for books youâ€™ve read.
- **Search & Filter**: Search and filter your books based on title or author.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Installation

Since Bookworm is a static web app, you don't need a backend server to run it. Follow the steps below to view the app locally.

### Steps to Run Locally

1. **Clone this repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/thebasilugo/bookworm.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   cd bookworm

3. Open the index.html file in your browser: Simply double-click on the index.html file to view the app locally.

   Alternatively, you can serve the files using a local server like Live Server in Visual Studio Code.

## Technologies Used

    HTML: Structure of the app.
    TailwindCSS: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive and modern design.
    JavaScript: For interactivity and dynamic content.

## How It Works

    The app is a static web application, so everything runs directly in the browser.
    It uses local storage to save your book data and reviews, so your collection is preserved even when you close the browser, also when you visit the app on another browser, you'll have to input your information all over again.
    TailwindCSS is used to ensure a clean and responsive design, which automatically adjusts to different screen sizes.
